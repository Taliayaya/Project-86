## Project Overview

This Project 86 fan game is in its early stages, with the primary goal of delivering a functional beta swiftly. We invite players to actively participate and provide feedback, steering the game in the right direction.
This project is made by the community, for the community. Any fan can contribute to it, both in term of coding, modeling or testing. As all the game files are available on this repository, contribution has been made easier. To discuss more about the project, [feel free to join the discord server](https://discord.gg/Yh2TQH97yA)

## Project Objectives

Our aim is to create a game that fully realizes the potential of the 86 universe. The game will feature two distinct playstyles:

### Juggernaut Mode (FPS)

The Juggernaut mode, also called FPS, is the game mode where players directly control a Juggernaut (or similar unit) in first person. They can hence experience the full traumatizing experience of piloting a walking-coffin and confronting the Legion. This mode allows the player to use the main cannon of the Juggernaut, its wires, secondary machines guns and more. To ensure your chance of success, keeping your scavenger alive is essential if you do not want to run out of ammunitions. 

> This game mode is currently the one prioritized and under the alpha version.

### Handler Mode (RTS)

The Handler mode, also called RTS, is a game mode where players play a role similar to the one of the serie. As a handler, players will command various squadrons, providing crucial information such as enemy localization and terrain data. Players can direct squads, alter their goals, and even "possess" a squadron to actively guide them towards mission objectives. This mode will incorporate FPS features and is planned for implementation after achieving a sufficiently stable version of the FPS.
The first test of this game mode will be the enemy version, where the handler pilot a Dinosauria and orders the Legion around: Ameise, Lowe, etc. and have to accomplish an objective without having their main unit destroyed (in this case a Dinosauria). The main unit will be similar to a boss unit, with a great firepower and resistance. 

## Multiplayer Vision

The ultimate goal is to create a multiplayer mode where RTS and FPS modes seamlessly coexist within the same game environment.

Please note that all aspects outlined here are currently theoretical and subject to change based on our team's capabilities, time constraints, and evolving ambitions.

## Download

While the game is still at an early development stage, we wish for players to actively participate in this project. Hence, players are already allowed to download the latest version and play on it.
Since the game is not completed, it may not exceed their expectations. Yet, because it does not reach it yet that it won't. And because of that, we hardly recommend anyone to share us their ideas or issues.

The game is not on Steam (yet) and players have two ways to download the game for now:

> Concerning Steam, fan games are not allowed without the authorization of the IP. Our goal is to grow a bit more and hope to reach an agreement with them to simply this procedure. 

### [PRERELEASE] Launcher

> **⚠ The launcher update system is currently in test! Try it out or Consider updating by downloading the .zip file through the [releases section](#latest-version).**

A launcher was made so that players do not have to go through the pain of re-downloading every new version. The launcher is not as powerful as Steam update system, yet it already avoids redownloading unchanged files and can hence make the download lighter.

- [Download the launcher](https://github.com/Project-86-Community/Project-86-Launcher/releases/latest)
- Execute the launcher
> Your computer will treat this EXE file as a virus. This is because we do not hold a certificate for it yet. This EXE is a compiled installer made from Visual Studio and [the app publicly available here](https://github.com/Project-86-Community/Project-86-Launcher)
- After installation, the game will be installed in `%Appdata%/Project-86-Community/Build/`. It is not possible with the current launcher to change the download folder. ([You can contribute and improve the launcher](https://github.com/Project-86-Community/Project-86-Launcher)
- Once the game is downloaded, click PLAY and enjoy.

### Latest version

If downloading the launcher is too much for you, you can simply download the latest build and execute it. This is not a long term recommendation as downloading the whole game every time for an update can be troublesome. 

- Go to [the latest version page](https://github.com/Taliayaya/Project-86/releases/latest)
- Download the .ZIP file matching the version (e.g. `Project86-vX.X.X-alpha.zip`)
- Extract it in any directory
- Execute `Project-86.exe`

> This method can also be a work-around if your computer does not let you download the launcher.

> `Mono not found`? Ensure that the download was done correctly and that the install path does not contain special character (only alphanumeric ones) as it may cause issues. If you have an error, you can [ask help on the discord server](https://discord.gg/Yh2TQH97yA)
