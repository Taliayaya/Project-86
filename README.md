## Project Overview

This Project 86 fan game is in its early stages, with the primary goal of delivering a functional beta swiftly. We invite players to actively participate and provide feedback, steering the game in the right direction.
This project is made by the community, for the community. Any fan can contribute to it, both in term of coding, modeling or testing. As all the game files are available on this repository, contribution has been made easier. To discuss more about the project, [feel free to join the discord server](https://discord.gg/Yh2TQH97yA)

## Project Objectives

Our aim is to create a game that fully realizes the potential of the 86 universe. The game will feature two distinct playstyles:

### Juggernaut Mode (FPS)

The Juggernaut mode, also called FPS, is the game mode where players directly control a Juggernaut (or similar unit) in first person. They can hence experience the full traumatizing experience of piloting a walking-coffin and confronting the Legion. This mode allows the player to use the main cannon of the Juggernaut, its wires, secondary machines guns and more. To ensure your chance of success, keeping your scavenger alive is essential if you do not want to run out of ammunitions. 

> This game mode is currently the one prioritized and under the alpha version.

### Handler Mode (RTS)

The Handler mode, also called RTS, is a game mode where players play a role similar to the one of the serie. As a handler, players will command various squadrons, providing crucial information such as enemy localization and terrain data. Players can direct squads, alter their goals, and even "possess" a squadron to actively guide them towards mission objectives. This mode will incorporate FPS features and is planned for implementation after achieving a sufficiently stable version of the FPS.
The first test of this game mode will be the enemy version, where the handler pilot a Dinosauria and orders the Legion around: Ameise, Lowe, etc. and have to accomplish an objective without having their main unit destroyed (in this case a Dinosauria). The main unit will be similar to a boss unit, with a great firepower and resistance. 

## Multiplayer Vision

The ultimate goal is to create a multiplayer mode where RTS and FPS modes seamlessly coexist within the same game environment.

Please note that all aspects outlined here are currently theoretical and subject to change based on our team's capabilities, time constraints, and evolving ambitions.

## Download

While the game is still at an early development stage, we wish for players to actively participate in this project. Hence, players are already allowed to download the latest version and play on it.
Since the game is not completed, it may not exceed their expectations. Yet, because it does not reach it yet that it won't. And because of that, we hardly recommend anyone to share us their ideas or issues.

The game is not on Steam (yet) and players have two ways to download the game for now:

> Concerning Steam, fan games are not allowed without the authorization of the IP. Our goal is to grow a bit more and hope to reach an agreement with them to simply this procedure. 

### Launcher

A launcher was made so that players do not have to go through the pain of re-downloading every new version. The launcher is not as powerful as Steam update system, yet it already avoids redownloading unchanged files and can hence make the download lighter.

- [Download the launcher](https://github.com/Taliayaya/Project-86/releases/download/v1.2.0-alpha/Project-86-Launcher-Setup-v1.0.3.msi)
- Execute the launcher
> Your computer will treat this EXE file as a virus. This is because we do not hold a certificate for it yet. This EXE is a compiled installer made from Visual Studio and [the app publicly available here](https://github.com/Taliayaya/Project-86-Launcher)
- After installation, the game will be installed in `%Appdata%/Project-86-Community/Build/`. It is not possible with the current launcher to change the download folder. ([You can contribute and improve the launcher](https://github.com/Taliayaya/Project-86-Launcher)
- Once the game is downloaded, click PLAY and enjoy.

### Latest version

If downloading the launcher is too much for you, you can simply download the latest build and execute it. This is not a long term recommendation as downloading the whole game every time for an update can be troublesome. 

- Go to the latest version page
- Download the .ZIP file matching the version
- Extract it in any directory
- Execute `Project-86.exe`

> This method can also be a work-around if your computer does not let you download the launcher.

> `Mono not found`? Ensure that the download was done correctly and that the install path does not contain special character (only alphanumeric ones) as it may cause issues. If you have an error, you can [ask help on the discord server](https://discord.gg/Yh2TQH97yA)

## How to Contribute

Project 86 is an open source fan game. Hence, anyone can freely contribute to his project and this part is here to help you to set up.
First, make sure to join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/Yh2TQH97yA). By doing so, communications will be made easier and you'll have access to the current tasks. These tasks are not only coding tasks. There are modeling, coding, musics, level design, art, story/lore, etc. Enough to find something you may do!

Secondly, make sure to have Unity. We are currently using `Unity 2022.3.22f1` (this will change with time). Make sure to have the same one. 

> We recently upgraded from 2021.3.29f1, make sure your Unity Version is up to date!!!

Thirdly, you have to download the files. Github seems to have issue making the ZIP file of the project so avoid using it. We recommend you to CLONE the project.
If you are new to Git and Github, this may seem frightening for you. If you are new to it, you should download the following softwares:
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) : To simplify the use of git if you are new to it.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) : Essential to clone the project and add your modifications (and used by Github Desktop, maybe the software installs Git for you?)
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) : An extension of Git used to manipulate the large files of our project, such as textures and models.

You first want to FORK the project into your github account (by clicking on the fork button on the page). This will create a "copy" of the project to your account where you'll have full rights to manipulate it and being then able to request to add your changes to the main project

>  You can be added to the contributors and directly be able to contribute from the main repository

You then want to clone the project with `git@github.com:Taliayaya/Project-86.git` (your fork URL) or open it with Github Desktop
![image](https://github.com/Taliayaya/Project-86/assets/84530101/35dbcc61-ffe5-4c93-b25f-08ca13c29324)

When this is done, you simply want to open the root with Unity and the version used. This will generate more files so make sure to have enough space to work on the project (At least 20 Go)
You then later on want to COMMIT and PUSH your and changes. For that, we advise you to contact us if you're new to all that.

To download the `Additional Assets` folder to fully open this project, please download it from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pkRBIPXqGKoHKCeHJVrc5NJOGXjXa1D8?usp=sharing
and extract it so that it is at the root of the `Assets` folder (the final path should be `Assets/Additional Assets`)

> Note: Previously, the `Additional Assets` folder was tracked using `Git LFS`. However, the bandwidth was consumed too fast (within a week). Hence, as this folder was taking 90% of the storage, it was removed from it.
> This file shouldn't have much modification or breaking change but should still be updated once in a while. (follow the discord for more information)

## Disclaimer

This project is still at a testing state and does not represent the complete game. Project 86 is a community-based fan game of the 86: Eighty Six license, developed in English.
